Hi there 👋👋 !

My name is Gaoxiang Tang(唐高翔), I'm currently a junior undergraduate student at the [School of Science ](http://lxy.ruc.edu.cn/), [Renmin University of China (RUC)](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/), pursuing a B.S. degree in Physics. In 2024, I will begin my doctoral studies at Tsinghua University's [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/), under the supervision of Professor [Yuka Wu](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/zh/wyk/). 

My research interest lies in quantum computation based on trapped ions. It's a fortune to be supervised by Prof. [Siang Zhang](https://siangzhang.github.io/contact) and to have the opportunity to work at TIQS(Trapped Ion Quantum Science), the lab facility operated by his group. During my undergraduate study, I was involved in the experimental realization of [PT symmetric Hamiltonian mediated state discrimination](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsta.2012.0160) in a single-ion trap and the implementation of [micromotion minimization methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00056) on the device TIQS.

My curriculum vitae can be downloaded [here (in English)](https://github.com/GaoxiangTang/gaoxiangtang.github.io/raw/main/docs/TGX_CV_en.pdf) or [here (in Chinese)](https://github.com/GaoxiangTang/gaoxiangtang.github.io/raw/main/docs/TGX_CV_zh.pdf) .
